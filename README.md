There are instructions for setting up a basic PHP/Apache server environment at [php-docker](https://github.com/codeadamca/php-docker).

We are using the [8.3.3-apache](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/php/8.3.3-apache/images/sha256-ba362589134fb620e24409c25e7cf2645bfb59eae70d6cfa6f3f8a73fe41c248?context=explore) Docker image.
